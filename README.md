# Brick Build Screensaver

Screensaver which builds virtual plastic building block structures.

Inspired by [Briblo](http://9031.com/goodies/#briblo) screensaver, which drops random blocks in a random position
onto a baseplate. I thought, "What if instead of random bricks in random locations, it built a specific structure
bottom-to-top?"
